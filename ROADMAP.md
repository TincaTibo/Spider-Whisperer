# Roadmap

## Minimum viable product
x Minimum parsing of packets to track TCP sessions membership in Whisperer
x Send TCP sessions every X s
o Have a local DNS cache valid for 1 hour (conf) and send the hostnames to server for every change
o Get configuration from conf server
o Authent
o Security
o HealthCheck

## 2nd step
o What about sessionless packets?
o Load complementary code from server (tcp...)
o Load the processing code from the server
o Get CPU/RAM at same time?
