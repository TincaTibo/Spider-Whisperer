# Roadmap

o Get configuration from conf server
o Minimum parsing of packets to track TCP sessions membership in Whisperer
    * Id packet : ./whisperer/{token}/timestamp/source/dest
        - Client as port between 49152 and 65535
    * Id session: id of first SYN packet or a GUID?
    * Session:
        - start
        - end (?)
        - size in/out
        - source ip:port
        - dest ip:port
        - whisperer
o Send TCP sessions every X s
o What about sessionless packets?
x Have a activatable sendToFile in // with different parameters
o Have a local DNS cache valid for 1 hour (conf) and send the hostnames to server for every change
o HealthCheck
o Authent
o Security
o Load the processing code from the server

o Get CPU/RAM at same time?
